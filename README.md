# 🩺 Liver Disease Prediction using Machine Learning  

## 📖 Project Overview  
Liver diseases are a major global health concern.  
This project applies *machine learning techniques* to predict liver disease using the  
*Indian Liver Patient Dataset (ILPD)*.  

The main steps of the project include:  
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling)  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) including correlation heatmaps  
- Model building with Logistic Regression  
- Model evaluation using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix  
- Cross-validation for reliable performance estimation

📊 Results
	•	Logistic Regression achieved:
	•	Accuracy (test set): ~76%
	•	Cross-Validation Mean Accuracy: ~71%
	•	The model performs well at detecting patients with liver disease but struggles with identifying healthy individuals (class imbalance issue).

🔮 Future Work
	•	Apply data balancing techniques (e.g., SMOTE)
	•	Explore advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM)
	•	Perform hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)
	•	Collect more balanced and larger datasets
	•	Improve feature engineering for better predictive power

⸻

⚠ Data Limitations
	•	The dataset is relatively small (~580 samples).
	•	Imbalanced classes (more patients with liver disease than healthy individuals).
	•	Medical data may include noise and measurement errors.
